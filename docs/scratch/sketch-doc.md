- **Project Goal Statement:** A technical specification and product requirements document for the Local MCP project. The goal is to document the architecture, functionality, and implementation details to support learning and development.
  
- Integration of AI tools (e.g., LLMs, ComfyUI, etc.) and the desired outcomes (e.g., improving productivity, creating a bridge between tools).

1. **What type of document are you writing?**  
   *Answer:* A technical specification and product requirements document for the Local MCP project. The goal is to document the architecture, functionality, and implementation details to support learning and development.

2. **Who is the primary audience?**  
   *Answer:* Myself, other designers and AIs like Claude, Github Copilot and Ollama Models

3. **What's the desired impact when someone reads this?**  
   *Answer:*
   - Reduce setup time for LLMs run them efficiently
   - Enable seamless data sharing between applications
   - To gain insights on how to use LLMs as assistants in the development process, improving productivity and skill-building

4. **Is there a template or specific format to follow?**  
   *Answer:* No, but I have an old example project that I plan to refactor and extend.

5. **Any other constraints or context I should know?**  
   *Answer:* Use well supported technology used in the professional world (e.g., FastAPI, Docker Compose, LangChain)
   - Project container
   - Better code management
   - Cleaner computer environment
   - Efficiently use LLMs to support work
   - Key functionalities include:  
     1. Manage secrets
     2. MCP proxy server
     3. Router service
     4. Enhancement middleware rules for endpoints
     5. Graceful fall back routing
